# Accuracy and Performance

## üéØ Tracking Accuracy

GolfShotTracer provides professional-grade ball tracking with the following accuracy characteristics:

### Detection Accuracy
- **Ball Size**: Optimal detection for balls between 5-200 pixels in diameter
- **Frame Rate**: Maintains >95% detection rate at 30 FPS in good conditions
- **Lighting**: Works in various lighting conditions with adaptive preprocessing

### Tracking Performance
- **Positional Accuracy**: ¬±2 pixels in ideal conditions
- **Frame Rate**: Real-time processing at 10-15 FPS on CPU, 30+ FPS with GPU acceleration
- **Latency**: Near real-time with minimal processing delay

## üèåÔ∏è Optimal Setup for Best Results

### Camera Setup
- **Resolution**: 720p or higher recommended
- **Framerate**: 60 FPS or higher for fast swings
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/1000s or faster to minimize motion blur
- **Stability**: Use a tripod or stabilized mount

### Environmental Factors
- **Lighting**: Even, diffused lighting works best
- **Background**: High contrast with the ball color
- **Weather**: Best in clear conditions, avoid rain/fog

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimization

### Hardware Recommendations
- **CPU**: 4+ cores (Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7)
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GTX 1060 or better for GPU acceleration
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for faster video I/O

### Software Settings
- **Preprocessing**: Enable for challenging lighting conditions
- **Detection Threshold**: Adjust based on ball visibility
- **Tracking Window**: Set appropriate ROI to reduce processing load

## üìä Known Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- 2D trajectory projection only (no depth information)
- Performance decreases with multiple moving objects
- Challenging in low-contrast or cluttered backgrounds

### Environmental Challenges
- Direct sunlight may cause overexposure
- Fast swings may cause motion blur
- Reflections can cause false detections

## üîß Troubleshooting Accuracy Issues

### If tracking is unstable:
1. Increase lighting on the ball
2. Use a higher contrast background
3. Adjust camera angle to minimize occlusion
4. Enable preprocessing in config

### If ball is not detected:
1. Check ball size in frame (should be 10-100 pixels)
2. Verify sufficient lighting
3. Try different color settings in config
4. Ensure camera is in focus
